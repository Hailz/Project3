#Technical Requirements

* Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
  * Note that if you build an app using Ionic, a backend is optional. However, look into services such as Firebase if you'd like a service for storing data.
* Have an interactive front-end, preferably using a modern front-end framework
* Be a complete product, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models. However, this is ultimately up to your discretion.
* Use a database, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
* Implement thoughtful user stories that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
* Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers
* Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible


# The Startup

  * What is your application (elevator pitch, ideally in one sentence)
  * What value does your application provide to your audience?
  * What steps have you taken to entice users? (user experience, a fancy frontend, trying out functionality before being forced to signup)


# Technologies Used:
  * Angular
  * Mongo
  * Express
  * Java Script

# User Stories:

  ## Annie is 21 and an avid user of hookup apps. As a result she has gone on some truely terrible dates. Rather than stick around through a terrible date, she needs a way to excuse herself that won't hurt her failed dates feelings.

  ## Sawyer is a 24 year old techie and loves going to hackathons and networking events. He has a difficult time finding excuses to leave conversations that he no longer wishes to participate in and wishes there was a way to just leave without seeming rude.

  ## Maisie is 33. She loves her family and friends but meeting their friends can be a bit of a gamble. She needs an easy way out when she knows things aren't going well that won't insult anyone and will preserve her relationships with her loved ones.

# Approach Taken:

  ## Day 1:
  We talked through what we wanted our app to do, went over user flow and wire frames, started planning out the neccessary routes and found an API that would allow us to send text messages. We spent a good part of the day wrestling with trying to get Twilio to work for us.

  ## Day 2:
  The struggle continues. Twilio will only send texts to Joe's phone today. We're looking into why and trying to fix that. We're also building out the routes and HTML for the rest of the app.
